            </h3>
            <p>
                I am someone who lives in In Groningen city. I am about 33 years old. I spend on average 3 hours per day on internet, surfing, reading, looking for information. It is really bothers me when the information I need is in the page but it is also difficult
                to be found or seen. lots of the times that is because of something wrong in the front-end design or in the database back-end.<br /> I have a good background about computers and internet, and it sounds good to get a payed
                job in that field. So I think that I can try making the internet better.
                <BR /> And one of the things tha t I hate very much is writing a C.V So I am writing here just to give the page some contents, but my attention is on the code side.

                    Learning strategies
                </span>
            </h3>
            <p>I have watched and read the studying strategies that mentioned by HackYourFuture. They are really helpful. In the next list I am going to describe some of them and what helps me to finish my homework, but in my own language and expressions.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not ever try to finish the whole thing in one time:
                    <br /> Make a plan and divide what you supposed to do on more than one session, and days. 1 or 2 session per day. Do not make your session long. 90 minutes at once, or 2 hours with break for 10 minutes between them.
                </li>
                <li>Do not use your brain for one study issue or task in the whole day:
                    <br /> switching is important. Divide your day on different tasks and different studies material. These need to have connection with each other but the are different on the way how be done.
                    <br /> For example, in the morning try just to read about and do not wary very much about understanding. In the next session try just to find examples that help your to understand more. Also you can study about material X in the morning
                    and then later about material Z in the next study session.
                </li>
                <li>Explain in details:
                    <br /> After learning something try to explain and describe it to yourself with much details as you can. During that you will release what you have missed or did not understand good.
                    <br /> This way helps your brain to build his own strategy to analyse and recover information.
                </li>
                <li>Let your brain rest:
                    <br /> Do something physical, move around, sport, clean your house. Something that you usually enjoy to do and no need for much thinking to be done. Things that your brain able to process unconsciously, and they help your body to be
                    good.
                </li>
